# To-Do List
Every year, I make a list of household cleaning that needs to be done. I wanted to use this for my project. I have heard the term "Honey-Do-List" as well. Currently in my life, I am working full-time as a teacher, aside from doing the Flex program for Software Engineering. My girlfriend and I are also expecting our first child together in December. So to say my time is limited is an understatement. So I came up with a list and put it into a json. I then wanted to make it have a click feature in order to delete items as they are completed. I also wanted to have a mouse-over to show some side notes.

### Requirements
* Have json-server installed

### Installation Instructions
* Fork and clone.
* Run json-server from terminal "json-server --watch db.json".
* Open index.html in the browser.# Liam-s-Phase-1-Project
* I used a website called font-awesome for my css
