What do you want to build for your first project?
### Step 1: Avenues for coming up with an idea:
* What problem do you have in your everyday life that you would like to solve? (better finances, finance app - never know what to make for dinner - meal randomizer)
* What are you passionate about? (gamer, movies, ffb, tech forum)

### Step 2: Working on the Overview
* Brainstorm about what kind of features you would like to have, write them down as you think of it, example:

A user can fill out a form where you can create a recipe with instructions on how to create and ingredients added to the recipe. A user can list out the recipes and select the recipe they may want to like or comment on. A user can delete their own recipes and edit their own recipes as well. A search bar to search through the list of recipes.

### Step 3: List out all of the features

* A user can like a todo (click) -
* A user can comment on a todo (submit)
* A user can delete their todo (click) -
* A user can edit their todo (submit) 
* A user can search their todo (submit)

### Step 4: Come up with an MVP

* List out todo (DOMContentLoaded)
* A user can delete their todo (click) -

### Step 5: List out your stretch goals
* A user can edit their todos (submit)
